# Weather_forecast
The Weather Forecast Project is a web-based application that allows users to get real-time weather information for any city around the world. It pulls data from an external API (typically OpenWeatherMap) and displays key weather details, such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The project typically includes:

Key Features:
City Search: Users can input a city name, and the app fetches weather details for that location.
Weather Information Display: Once a city is searched, the app shows weather data like:
Current temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)
Humidity level
Weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy)
Responsive Design: The app layout is designed to be responsive, so it works across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
Error Handling: If an invalid city name is entered or the city is not found, an error message is displayed to the user.
User Interface: The app features a clean and user-friendly interface with a search bar and display area for the weather information. It includes animations for smooth user interaction (e.g., button hover effects, transitions, and background animations).
Technologies Used:
Frontend:
HTML: For the basic structure of the web page.
CSS: For styling the user interface, including layout, colors, fonts, and animations.
JavaScript: For fetching the weather data from the API, processing it, and updating the DOM.
API: OpenWeatherMap API (or another weather data provider) is used to get weather information.
